# Script_Installer

I think I'm overcomplicating the installation process but:
to run the script smoothly clone the repository to the ~/ path,
otherwise when it comes to running the same script again the system will show errors.

Move the Main DockInStation file to the ~/ folder of your current user;
Delete the Script_Installer folder (it will be eventually moved to /tmp directory)

chmod +x the script

RUN THE SCRIPT AS ROOT, either by running sudo or just using the root account

To execute the script just type ./DockInStation.sh or sudo ./DockInStation.sh
